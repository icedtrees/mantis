* 1.1.0
    * NOTE: This point release contains significant and possibly breaking
      changes. The main feature is the addition of support for the Dynamixel
      AX-S1 sensor module. To enable this support some significant changes were
      needed, see below:
    * Adds AX-S1 support
    * A new sensor-example.py script is available from github source
    * The example.py script has been revamped further.
    * A new DEVICES name replaces AX12 in defs.py and also contains AXS1
    * Methods for finding register lengths for a given module exist in their
      classes as opposed to on the network class.
    * Register lengths must now be passed into network requests.
      See read_register() and read_registers() in DynamixelInterface
    * Register lengths are now part of descriptions of registers in defs.py
    * Descriptions in defs.py are now dicts to support the above and further
      extensions.
    * PEP8 Cleanup
* 1.0.3
    * Fixes a bug in example.py on linux
* 1.0.2
    * Updates example script to be more user friendly
* 1.0.1
    * Initial release of pydynamixel to PyPI.
